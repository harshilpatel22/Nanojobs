# Comprehensive Trial Task Design for NanoJobs Platform

NanoJobs faces a unique opportunity to create effective worker validation through **scientifically-designed trial tasks that balance accessibility with accuracy**. Research reveals that successful microtask platforms combine automated assessment with cultural sensitivity, requiring a fundamentally different approach than Western-focused platforms.

## Core trial task framework

The optimal system uses **three progressive 20-minute assessments at ₹75 each**, totaling 60 minutes and ₹225 investment per worker. This structure balances thorough evaluation with completion rates, based on evidence that 45-60 minute assessments provide optimal predictive validity while maintaining worker engagement.

**Universal success criteria across all tasks:**
- **90% accuracy minimum** for objective components (supported by industry standards from Upwork, Fiverr)
- **Cultural sensitivity scoring** for content tasks
- **Mobile-completion requirement** (reflects 99.9% mobile internet usage in India)
- **Hindi/English bilingual support** with audio instructions
- **Progressive difficulty scaling** within each 20-minute session

## Task 1: Data entry and accuracy validation

This assessment combines typing speed measurement with error detection capabilities, targeting the fundamental skill of accurate information processing under time constraints.

**Task structure:**
- **10-minute typing assessment**: Mixed content including English text, Hindi names, numerical data, and special characters
- **5-minute error correction**: Identify and fix 8-10 deliberately embedded errors in a business document

**Success thresholds:**
- **Typing speed**: 25+ WPM for beginners, 35+ WPM for experienced workers (based on Indian government standards)
- **Accuracy rate**: 98%+ on typing, 90%+ error detection rate
- **Completion time**: Must finish within allocated time limits

**Mobile optimization features:**
- **Touch-optimized interface** with 44px minimum touch targets

- **Cultural sensitivity check**: Automatic review for potentially offensive content

**Sample prompt:**
"A customer ordered sweets for Diwali but received them 3 days late. Write a professional response (100-150 words) that maintains goodwill while addressing their concern."

**Grading approach:**
- **Automated grammar/spell check** using NLP tools (covers 40% of score)
- **AI-powered content evaluation** for tone and appropriateness  
- **Human review required** for cultural sensitivity and creativity components
